title: "Non Technical Things"

I exist outside of projects, school, and work! I spend some of my extra time climbing which is an enjoyable, problem solving way exercise. I am a fan of video games, from playing multiplayer with my friends to puzzle games alone. Cooking is also an important part of my life.
