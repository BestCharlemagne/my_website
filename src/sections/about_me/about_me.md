title: "About Me"
---

I am a second-year computer science student at Georgia Tech. Most of my experience is in Android Development, but I love learning about new programming frameworks and language. My education at Georgia Tech has fostered my transition of programming as a hobby, to being able to program professionaly. As my education progresses, I will continue to learn more, and broaden my world view through the wide variety of people and ideas with whom I interact. Outside of school, I love rock climbing, where I am able to express my creativity with the movements of my body.

Some of the languages and frameworks I use:
- Java
- Kotlin
- Android
- HTML/CSS/Javascript
- Flutter and Dart  <div id="projects"></div>
- Python
