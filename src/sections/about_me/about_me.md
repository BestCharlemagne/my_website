I am a third-year computer science student at Georgia Tech. My classes are focused on [Intelligence](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/content/intelligence) and [Systems and Architecture](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/content/systems-architecture). This means that I have taken courses in machine learning, artificial intelligence, assembly, computer architecture and more.
